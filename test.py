The mayor, Lisa Tran, announced the plan in front of a large crowd gathered at City Hall. The initiative includes major investments in solar and wind infrastructure, as well as incentives for residents to install rooftop solar panels.
Environmental advocacy groups such as Green Future Coalition applauded the decision, calling it a bold and necessary step in the fight against climate change.
However, some local businesses expressed concern over the potential rise in energy costs and the feasibility of implementing the new grid technologies in a short time frame.
Despite mixed reactions, the city council passed the resolution unanimously, marking a major milestone in Greenhavenâ€™s environmental policy.
